The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers   about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.
The system takes into account several factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models.
Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models.
Based on the trained models, the system recommends the most suitable crops for the given input parameters.
The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily input their data, view recommendations, and explore additional information.
Data Input Collection: The system enables users to input essential data, including soil parameters, climate information, and geographic location.
Data Preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables.
Model Training and Evaluation: The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
